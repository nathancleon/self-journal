# Mentalnote

Mentalnote is an application built with your daily mental health in mind. The intention behind the app is for the user to log in every day and go through a series of prompts regarding their mental health. You can go to your dashboard and view a list of all your journal entries for each day and see your individual scores and notes for each prompt.
